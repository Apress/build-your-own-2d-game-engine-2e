		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>As we have already mentioned, GameObjects allow us to control the behavior of the elements in our game as well as the interactions between them. In this tutorial, we look at using rigid bodies to apply physics to our GameObjects and creating particles.</p>

		<h2><a id="resolution"></a>Collision Resolution</h2>
		<p>In Tutorial 3, we looked at detecting collisions between game elements. With per-pixel collision detection, we checked to determine 
            if one element overlaps another. While this is very useful, for most games we need more than to just detect collisions. We need to 
            look at collision resolution where the engine will detect a collision through overlap and "undo" the overlap before it is drawn to the screen.</p>
		<p> To do this, we will apply an &quot;invisible shape&quot; over our GameObject where physics calculations will occur to simulate objects 
            having mass and not being able to pass through each other. The game engine supports the use of rectangles and circles as rigid shapes. 
            While these shapes are not as precise as the per-pixel collision detection we saw previously, for determining locations of objects for 
            collision resolution, these shapes work very well. By setting a virtual mass  to these shapes, the engine will calculate what happens when these objects collide.</p>
		<p>We create a new rigid bodies object, set its size and apply it to a GameObject using the <code>setRigidBody()</code> function. 
            To simulate the physics of the game, we call the engine's physics processing functions such as <code>physics.collideShape()</code>for 
            resolving the physics interactions between two bodies.</p>
        <h3>Using Rigid Bodies</h3>
        <p>In the next example, we will create two renderables, a minion and a platform.
             We will place the platform in the center of our scene and allow keys to control movement of the minion.
              Using rigid bodies, we will make it so the minion cannot pass through the platform.</p>
        <p>You can see the running example <a href="../Tutorial-Source/index4a.html" target="_blank">here</a>. 
            The WASD keys move the minion around the screen. The 'C' key will show/hide the rigid rectangles for the GameObjects so you can view 
             the locations of our &quot;rigid&quot; boundaries.</p>
        
        <figure><img src="./tutorial4a-capture.PNG" width="400" height="400">
       	  <figcaption>Figure 4-1: GameObjects Using Rigid Bodies</figcaption>
      	</figure>
        
        <p>First, we declare our instance variables and constants. Next, we load in our assets. 
            In this example, we load in graphics for the minion (as part of our minion sprite sheet from previous examples) and the 
            platform. We also write our parallel unload calls.</p>
        <p>Though rigid bodies are an abstract representation for behavior, there is an area of effect 
            associated with them called the bounding region. For demonstration purposes, we create a variable, <code>this.mShowBounds</code>, 
            to allow us to control drawing the bounding region. Since we are only using Renderables as arguments to GameObjects we don't need a variable for them.</p>

    <p>In the initialization function, we create our camera as we have done before. We create a minion GameObject and platform GameObject in a similar way as we have done before, this time 
        we don't keep track of the renderables separate from the GameObjects.

        <p>We continue our initialization by creating our rigid bodies. We create a rigid rectangle with the GameObject's transform and a size for the rigid body, 
            by passing in the transform when the physics module acts on the RigidShape it also acts on the GameObject. We make the rigid bodies slightly smaller than their 
            GameObject because of the empty space around the texture.
             Notice, for the platform, we set a mass of zero. This makes it so that collision with other bodies will not transfer motion (momentum) to this body.</p>

	<p>A call to <code>engine.physics.collideShape()</code> checks if collision occurs with the two RigidShape bounds and will resolve collisions between them. 
        If we were dealing with more than two objects that can possible cross-collide (like balls on a billiard table) that need to be resolved 
        simultaneously with respect to each other, we need to have a means of handling collisions on a bigger scale. For this, we create a set or sets 
        of game objects and use <code>engine.physics.processObjToSet()</code> or <code>engine.physics.processSetToSet()</code> to resolve collisions with one call. 
        The <em>ObjToSet</em> call would handle a single object against a set of objects while <em>SetToSet</em> would check the objects in a set against the objects in another set.</p>

		<h2><a id="particles"></a>Particles</h2>
		<p>Particles are small objects that emit from a point. Over time, the particle will move further away from the emitter and change in size, 
            color and/or opacity until it eventually dissipates. Emitters can be used to simulate smoke, explosions and rain. In the game engine, 
            particles are implemented by a new type of object: <strong>Particle</strong>. Since we could be handling hundreds of 
            Particle objects, we will group them in a <strong>ParticleSet</strong> to ease the task of tracking and manipulating them.</p>
        <p>In this next example, we are going to create a <b>ParticleEmitter</b> object to handle the creation of the Particles. The particles will emit from our current mouse location and will fall 
            as if under the influence of gravity. We retain all of our code from before and add particle functionality. </p>
        <p>You can view this example <a href="../Tutorial-Source/index4b.html" target="_blank">here</a> for a demonstration. The WASD keys move the 
            minion around the screen. Clicking the 'Z' key will create a ParticleEmitter object at the current mouse location. The 'C' key will show/hide the RigidRectangle bounds for the GameObjects.</p>

       	  <figcaption>Figure 4-2: Generating Particles</figcaption>
      	</figure>
        <p>In our constructor, we identify the texture and load/unload it. We also allocate a new ParticleGameObjectSet object. We can do this here as opposed to the initialize function because it's allocation does not depend on any loaded resources. The set will store all of our particles so that we can treat them as one object rather than dozens or hundreds.</p>

		<p>In our update function, we update all particles and check to see if the Z key is pressed. When pressed,

            of particles for us while updating. The fourth argument of addEmitterAt() is a function that we have to implement that actually creates a Particle instance, changes its properties

In this example, we set the life to a random range from 30 - 330 cycles before it expires (don't forget, the game engine runs at 60 frames per second so a particle can last from 0.5 seconds to almost 5.5 seconds). The initial color is red.</li>
		  <li>Set up an initial size from 5.5 to 6 units in world coordinate space</li>
		  <li>Setup the final color at <strong>red</strong> = 3.5-4.5, <strong>blue</strong> = 0.4 - 0.5 and <strong>green</strong> = 0.3 - 0.4. The red is oversaturated and will give a very bright flamelike effect. The <strong>alpha</strong> component will end at 0.6 so it will appear to become translucent.</li>
		  <li>Setup the velocity of the particle. The X component will be -10 to +10 units. The Y component will be 0 - 10. By default, the engine  implements a drag on these velocities of 5% per update. It also increases the downward Y velocity to simulate gravitational acceleration.</li>
		  <li>Setup the size delta. In this case, the particles will reduce in size by 2% every update.</li>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Rigid shapes have a many uses in games. They can be used to simulate floor and walls so that GameObjects can be constrained in their movement. They can also be used to make interactions between GameObjects more realistic. Particles give us impressive visual affects. Aside from explosions, we could simulate smoke or weather affects with particles.</p>
        <p>In <a href="tutorial5.html">Tutorial 5</a>, we will take a look at more visual affects by illuminating renderables with custom lighting.</p>
