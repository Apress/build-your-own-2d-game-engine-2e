# Networked Multiplayer Game API
### Authors: Drew, Ethan, Matt (Group 1)

This repository contains an extended version of the game engine presented in Kelvin Sung's *Build Your Own 2D Game Engine and Create Great Web Games* book. The original source code can be found [here](https://github.com/Apress/build-your-own-2d-game-engine-2e). The Chapter 7.6 version of the engine was used as a starting point for this version of the engine. This modified version of the engine was created as a final project for CSS 452.

This version of the game engine allows for the development of *multiplayer games.*

The documentation can be found [here](https://students.washington.edu/mattheso/css452-project/) or in `docs/out`.
